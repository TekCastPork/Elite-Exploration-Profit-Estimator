# TekCastPork's Elite: Dangerous Exploration Data Profit Estimator

Please at least read the how to install and run sections, as that process isnt drag and drop yet. It will be eventually, but not yet.

## What is this?

This is a program I am working on that attempts to help Elite: Dangerous pilots determine their profits from exploration data.
It watches the verbose log file generated by Elite: Dangerous and looks for specific events that relate to exploration.

## Why did I write this?

I've been in the mood to do a lot of exploring in the game recently and noticed that the game doesn't give you an estimate for your exploration profits. I'd like to 
know my profits so I can begin planning upgrades to my ship before I get back. As far as I can see no other companion app gives you this number. 
This makes you have to calculate your profits by hand, which I find time-consuming and stops me from exploring.
So I spent some time and coded a program that can do this for me, and I'm giving it to other pilots that wish to know their exploration profits aswell.

# HOW TO INSTALL

1. This program currently only works on Windows based systems. I'm hoping to make it available for OSX, but as I do not have a Mac it's a little hard to code for one.
2. Download the latest version from this github repo. It will arrive in a .zip format
3. Navigate to your user folder (usually C:\Users\<your_username_here>) and extract the folder contained in the .zip
4. For convienence you can place a shortcut to the jar file on your desktop to make starting the program easier.

# HOW TO RUN

1. Start the program. DO NOT SPAM CLICK THROUGH THE MESSAGE WINDOWS, THEY TELL YOU WHAT TO DO AT THIS TIME!
2. In case you DID spam click through the message windows, next start your instance of Elite: Dangerous and load into your preferred area (open, private group, or solo)
3. Now you can click past the second message window and the program should begin running normally.

NOTE: If your journal file (the verbose log file I read) somehow gets to over 500,000 lines, which would be a nice feat and I congratulate that pilot, this program will require restarting as it does not
yet automatically move to the next journal file. It's in ALPHA for a reason.
